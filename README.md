E-Learning Platform
This E-Learning Platform is a university project developed as part of my software engineering curriculum. The project aims to create an online learning environment where users can explore, enroll in, and track their progress through various courses. It is designed with a user-friendly interface for both students and administrators to manage courses, lessons, and user authentication.

Course Browsing: Users can browse available courses, view details, and search by category or rating.
Course Enrollment: Students can enroll in courses, and admins can manage available courses.
Lesson Viewing: Enrolled users can view lessons and track their progress.
Progress Tracking: Users can track their progress in courses, including lessons viewed and courses completed.
Admin Panel: Admins can manage users, courses, and lessons through a dedicated control panel.

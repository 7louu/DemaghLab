# DemaghLab
E-Learning Platform
This E-Learning Platform is a university project developed as part of my software engineering curriculum. The project aims to create an online learning environment where users can explore, enroll in, and track their progress through various courses. It is designed with a user-friendly interface for both students and administrators to manage courses, lessons, and user authentication.

The name "DemaghLab" is inspired by the Tunisian dialect, particularly the word "Demagh," which refers to the brain or mind. By using this term, the platform emphasizes its goal of stimulating learning, creativity, and knowledge, while making it more relatable and accessible to Tunisian users. The name reflects a modern and engaging educational experience, grounded in local culture and language.
